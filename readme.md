####puppymash

My first Rails project for an open-ended CS235 assignment. A clone of Mark Zuckerberg's [facemash](http://vimeo.com/24543171), but with puppies (provided by Flickr and [flickr_fu](https://github.com/commonthread/flickr_fu)). 

#####Setup
The flickr_fu dependency is specified in the gemfile, just run `bundle install` and you should be good to go. My Flickr API key is in flickr.yml, please don't abuse it.
